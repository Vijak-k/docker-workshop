This section is introduction to docker an its application in data engineering. Docker is a software that we use to isolate softwares in a separated environment - _containerize_. Using docker helps reproducibility of softwares in difrrent machine, preventing _Oops !! I cannot run this software on my PC_. It is also more resource-efficient than traditional virtual machines because containers share the host system's resources and can be easily removed when no longer needed.
